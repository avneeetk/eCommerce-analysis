## **Files in the Repository**
1. **`Avneet_Kaur_EDA.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook for Task 1 (EDA and Business Insights).
2. **`Avneet_Kaur_EDA.pdf`**: PDF report for Task 1.
3. **`Avneet_Kaur_Lookalike.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook for Task 2 (Lookalike Model).
4. **`Avneet_Kaur_Lookalike.csv`**: CSV file containing lookalike recommendations for the first 20 customers.
5. **`Avneet_Kaur_Clustering.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook for Task 3 (Customer Segmentation).
6. **`Avneet_Kaur_Clustering.pdf`**: PDF report for Task 3.
7. **`requirements.txt`**: List of Python libraries required to run the code.
8. **`README.md`**: This file.

## **Dataset**
The dataset consists of three files:
1. **`Customers.csv`**: Contains customer profile information.
2. **`Products.csv`**: Contains product details.
3. **`Transactions.csv`**: Contains transaction details.

## **Setup Instructions**
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/avneeetk/eCommerce-analysis.git
   cd eCommerce-analysis
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, install the required libraries using:
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    Run the Code:
    Open the Jupyter Notebooks (Avneet_Kaur_EDA.ipynb, Avneet_Kaur_Lookalike.ipynb, Avneet_Kaur_Clustering.ipynb) in Jupyter or any compatible IDE.
    Execute the cells in the notebooks to perform EDA, build the Lookalike Model, and perform Customer Segmentation.
